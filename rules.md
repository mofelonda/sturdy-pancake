# X-Team n/a Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
Delegate tasks based upon team members' strengths. In the event that there is no obvious assignment for a task, it will be assigned randomly.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Create a checklist file on github that each member will update upon completion of tasks.


## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Constant communication is key. If unable to work together, there are multiple ways to contact each other for assistance, such as e-mail, text message, etc.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Multiple milestone dates will be determined between the start of the assignment and the final deadline. On each of these dates, we will have multiple goals that should be reached. In the event that tasks are left incomplete before the milestone, we will convene to determine how those tasks should be handled going forward.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
We should be in constant communication with each other, especially regarding difficulties with tasks and strategies used to overcome said difficulties.  
All members should review finished tasks, even those not assigned to them.
